# Meals

A Flutter App that shows Meal Recipes.

## What's learned:

Navigation:
- The Flutter Navigator allows you to switch (push/pop/replace) between pages;
- You can use named routes or unnamed routes;
Passing Data:
- Data can be passed between pages via arguments (directly or via "arguments" key);
- Data can be passed back, too (read via Future);
- Data can be anything (string, int, object...);
Tabs:
- You can add tabs in the AppBar or at the bottom of the page;
- Tabs allow you to switch between different stacks (i.e. no popping);
Drawers & Dialogs:
- Drawers (side menus) also allow you to switch between different stacks;
- Drawers and other dialogs (e.g. alerts, modal bottom sheet) can be closed via Navigator.pop()).
